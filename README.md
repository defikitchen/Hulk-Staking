In order to install MetaMask, visit the official MetaMask website. Or access the MetaMask download page directly and follow these steps:

Then select ‘settings’. Scroll down to the ‘Extensions’-overview, and look for ‘Web3 provider for using Dapps’, select ‘MetaMask’. Once it’s done, refresh (CTRL+SHIFT+R for a hard refresh) the page and try again.

## Withdrawing your earnings

It is not possible to initiate withdrawals during the initial 30-day lock-up period. After this period your dashboard shows two actions you can choose from.

Unlock staking. This button can be used to start collecting your accumulated rewards. Pushing this button and completing the MetaMask transaction initiates the 7-day cool-down period. After the cool-down period you are able to claim your accumulated rewards. Keep in mind, this action comes with transaction fees on the Ethereum network.

Collect rewards. This button can be used for unstaking, by which you automatically claim your initial stake + all accumulated rewards. Only use this button if you wish to stop staking, and clicking it will initiate the 7-day cool-down period. After the cool-down period you are able to (re)claim your stake and rewards.
